    Project Overview
  </b><br>
  A first person horror game developed in Unity, using AI to provide a new kind of immersive experience. We used mediapipe's AI model in python to use the webcam on user's device to track whether the user's eyes were open or not. We use this aspect to make the game scarier because the monster hunting you throughout the game can not hurt you when the player's eyes are close but there is an increase in audio to increase the level of fear in the game.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Goals:</b>
    <li>Create AI module to take users eyes</li>
    <li>Use tracking AI to changes players State</li>
    <li>Create a funcional and scary enemy</li>
    <li>Add a smooth movement system</li>
    <li>Create a scary game level</li></li>
    <li>Unitlize texture and sounds</li>
</p>

<p>
     <b>Player experiences:</b>
    The players Goal is to find the dead body in by looking through the rooms avoiding the killer and not dying. A user and either hide from the kill when looking for the body, or they can close their eyes to avoid the killer being able to harm them.
