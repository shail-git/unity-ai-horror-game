    Project Overview
  </b><br>
  A horror game developed in Unity, using AI to provide a new kind of immersive experience. We trained an AI model to use the webcam on user's device to track whether the user'ss eyes were open or not. We use this aspect to make the game scarier because the monster hunting you throughout the game can not hurt you when the player's eyes are close but there is an increase in audio to increase the level of fear in the game.
